## About Me

Welcome! I am currently an assistant professor at School of Public Administration, [Hunan University](https://www-en.hnu.edu.cn/), China. Prior to that, I was a lecturer (equivalent to assistant professor) at School of Political Science and Public Administration at [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/), China (2022-2025). I received my PhD degree in Political Science from Hong Kong's [Lingnan University](https://www.ln.edu.hk/) in 2022. My research focuses on media & politics, public opinion, Chinese politics and public policy. My work has been published or is forthcoming in journals such as *Comparative Politics*, *Policy Sciences*, *Political Behavior*, *Political Research Quarterly*, and *The China Quarterly*.
